# PortfolioOverview
View all your assets' current values.

## Idea
I want to view the current values of all my assets in one convenient dashboard. My assets are on different platforms like Binance, Bitvavo, eToro,...

With the help of API's I want to update the portfolio's value.

This app was written as a demo project to learn [Angular](https://angular.io/).

### To make it run after downloading:

- Copy the file `portfolio_example.ts` in the `src/app/data` folder to `portfolio.ts` in the same folder. 
- Edit `portfolio.ts` to reflect your investment portfolio and
- run the app.
