# PortfolioOverview
View all your assets' current values.

## Idea
I want to view the current values of all my assets in one convenient dashboard. My assets are on different platforms like Binance, Bitvavo, eToro,...

With the help of API's I want to update the portfolio's value.

This app was written as a demo project to learn [Angular](https://angular.io/).

### To make it run after downloading:
- navigate to the homepage
- click on `Upload a portfolio`
- click on `Download example JSON`
- edit the downloaded file to reflect your portfolio.
- Upload the edited file.

All data will be stored in your local browser storage and will not reside on eny server. You only have to upload your initial file once.

It is also possible to save your current portfolio. (`Download JSON`)

directly editing and maling new entries in your portfolio is coming. This will be available in the `Admin Panel` section of the app.
